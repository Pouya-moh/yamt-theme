# yamt-theme
Or "Yet Another Material Theme" is an emacs theme inspired by [sublime material theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).
It is created with help of [theme-creator](https://github.com/mswift42/theme-creator). Note this is not yet fully implemented!

### TODO
1. Organize settings in semantic groups, e.g., put all search related results next to each other
2. Modify colors for other packages (this gonna take a while...!)
3. Add some screenshots
